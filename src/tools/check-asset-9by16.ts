    const prompt = `You are analyzing an image that will be used for 9:16 vertical video content. Please perform the following analysis:

1. **WATERMARK CHECK**: First and most importantly, carefully examine the ENTIRE image for any watermarks, including:
   - Text watermarks (company names, photographer credits, stock photo text)
   - Logo watermarks (transparent or semi-transparent logos)
   - Pattern watermarks (repeating patterns or grids)
   - Copyright marks or attribution text
   - Any overlaid text that appears to be a watermark
   - Check ALL corners and edges, as well as the center
   - Look for subtle, semi-transparent overlays

2. **IF WATERMARK FOUND**: Stop the analysis and respond with:
   "REJECTED: Watermark detected - [describe location and type of watermark]. This image cannot be used."

3. **IF NO WATERMARK**: Analyze how to crop this image for 9:16 aspect ratio:
   - Identify the main subject(s) or focal point(s) of the image
   - Determine the current aspect ratio and dimensions
   - Provide specific cropping instructions that preserve the main subject(s)
   - If the main subject(s) cannot be preserved in 9:16 format, explain why

Your response should be in one of these formats:

**Format 1 (Watermark Found):**
REJECTED: Watermark detected - [specific description and location]. This image cannot be used.

**Format 2 (Can be cropped to 9:16):**
APPROVED: No watermarks detected.
CROPPING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Main subject: [describe what needs to be preserved]
- Recommended crop: [specific instructions like "crop from center, removing X pixels from left/right" or "focus on upper/lower portion"]
- Notes: [any additional considerations]

**Format 3 (Cannot be cropped to 9:16):**
REJECTED: No watermarks detected, but image cannot be cropped to 9:16 while preserving main subject(s).
Reason: [explain why - e.g., "horizontal panorama with subjects spread across entire width", "main subjects at opposite edges"]
Recommendation: Delete this image and find another suitable for vertical format.`;
