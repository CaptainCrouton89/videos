# Veo 2

Veo 2 is a video generation model designed to create videos with realistic motion and high-quality output (up to 4K resolution). The model can be accessed via VideoFX and Vertex AI.

## Key Features

### Quality and Control

* Follows both simple and complex instructions
* Simulates real-world physics
* Supports a wide range of visual styles

### Technical Capabilities

* Enhanced realism and detail with reduced artifacts
* Advanced motion representation with accurate physics simulation
* Precise interpretation of camera instructions (shot styles, angles, movements)

## Benchmarks

Veo 2 has been evaluated against other video generation models through human ratings on the MovieGenBench dataset (1003 prompts, released by Meta). Testing parameters: - 720p resolution for all comparisons - Veo samples: 8 seconds duration - VideoGen samples: 10 seconds duration - Other models: 5 seconds duration

## Known Limitations

* Challenges with maintaining complete consistency throughout complex scenes
* Difficulty with complex motion
* Some limitations in creating highly realistic or intricate videos
