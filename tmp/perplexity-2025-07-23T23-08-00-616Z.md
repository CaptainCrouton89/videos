For 2025, the **exact parameter names used for image URLs in image-to-video models on Replicate and similar platforms** are as follows, per latest API schemas and documentation:

---

### 1. **seedance-pro (Bytedance Seedance 1.0 Pro)**

- **Parameter Name:** `image_url`
- **Usage:** URL string to the input image
- **Example API Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "prompt": "A skier glides over fresh snow, joyously smiling while kicking up large clouds of snow as he turns. Accelerating gradually down the slope, the camera moves smoothly alongside.",
      "resolution": "1080p",
      "duration": "5",
      "image_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/seedance_pro_i2v_img.jpg"
    }
    ```
- **Source:** [1]

#### Alternative (Byteplus ModelArk direct API)
- **Parameter Path:** In a request content list:
  - `[ { "type": "image_url", "image_url": { "url": "..." } } ]`
  - *This is more common in low-level model endpoints or when chaining text + image(s) in content, not the main public API.*
- **Source:** [5]

---

### 2. **mochi-1**

- **Parameter Name:** *Not explicitly documented in 2025 search results, but based on current conventions and similar models, likely names:*
    - `input_image`
    - `image` or
    - `image_url`
- **Supporting Reasoning:** All major image-to-video APIs follow the `image_url`/`image`/`input_image` convention. If following Seedance and Pyramid-Flow (see below), it is most often `image_url`.
- **Limitation:** No direct schema in indexed search results; confirm with latest Replicate API docs for mochi-1 for exact string, but `image_url` is the industry default in 2025.[1][5]

---

### 3. **wan-i2v-720p, wan-i2v-480p (Wavespeed Wan 2.1 / Wan i2v variants)**

- **Parameter Name:** *Not directly disclosed in public docs, but by convention and community code samples:*
    - `image` or
    - `input_image` or
    - `image_url`
- **Best Practice:** Refer to the official replicate.com/model/[slug]/api or their OpenAPI documentation for schema, but community usage and similar models use `image` or `image_url` as the parameter.[4]
- **Limitation:** Search results do not include the full REST/JSON schema, but indicate these options. Use `image_url` as primary candidate for code unless published models show otherwise.

---

### 4. **pyramid-flow**

- **Parameter Name:** *Not found in search result schema directly. Industry and Replicate API practice is:*
    - `image` or
    - `image_url`
- **Supporting Reasoning:** Consistent with other image-to-video model parameters in Listing 2025[1]; check the official model API for exact parameter.
- **Limitation:** No explicit search result for current Pyramid-Flow naming in 2025 API.

## Parameter name mapping (summary table):

| Model               | Parameter name for image URL         | Example field usage                                    | Source  |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| **seedance-pro**    | `image_url`                         | `"image_url": "https://some-site.com/image.jpg"`       | [1][5]  |
| **mochi-1**         | *(likely)* `image_url`              | `"image_url": "https://some-site.com/image.jpg"`       | [1][5]* |
| **wan-i2v-720p/480p** | *(likely)* `image_url`, `image`   | `"image_url": "https://some-site.com/image.jpg"`       | [4]*    |
| **pyramid-flow**    | *(likely)* `image_url`, `image`     | `"image_url": "https://some-site.com/image.jpg"`       | [1]*    |

\*Assumed based on industry pattern, Seedance/Replicate conventions, and minimal model API differences in 2025.

## API Example (JSON input):

For Seedance Pro and other image-to-video models with documented `image_url`:
```json
{
  "prompt": "An astronaut floating in the expanse of space above a sprawling Earth, distant stars twinkling in the background.",
  "resolution": "1080p",
  "duration": "5",
  "image_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/seedance_pro_i2v_img.jpg"
}
```
[1]

For Byteplus/ModelArk low-level API (for completeness):
```json
{
  "model": "seedance-1-0-lite-i2v-250428",
  "content": [
    { "type": "text", "text": "Dramatic sunrise over a forest..." },
    { "type": "image_url", "image_url": { "url": "https://somedomain.com/myimage.png" } }
  ]
}
```

## Key Insights:

- **`image_url`** is the most widely adopted, consistent parameter name for supplying the image input in Replicate and derivative model APIs for image-to-video tasks as of 2025[1][5].
- Other variants like `image` or `input_image` are sometimes seen, but `image_url` is the default in official APIs.
- Always use the documented schema provided by each model's official API reference, as custom projects or forks might slightly differ.
- If the model supports nested content structures (like ModelArk/Byteplus), images may be wrapped under an `"image_url": { "url": "..." }` object in a content array.

---

### Limitations

- For mochi-1, wan-i2v, and pyramid-flow, current search results do **not** show raw OpenAPI or JSON schema. The conclusions above are derived from industry-wide conventions and Seedance public documentation.
- Always confirm with the interactive API documentation or OpenAPI/Swagger page for the specific modelâ€”parameter names can subtly change between versions even in the same family.
