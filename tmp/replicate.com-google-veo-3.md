✨ Prompting Tips (from Google’s Guide) To get the best results, try these prompt strategies:

Shot Composition: “Close-up,” “two shot,” “over-the-shoulder”

Lens & Focus: “Macro lens,” “shallow focus,” “wide-angle lens”

Genre & Style: “Sci-fi,” “romantic comedy,” “action movie”

Camera Motion: “Zoom shot,” “dolly shot,” “tracking shot,” “pan shot”

**Example Prompt:**

Close up shot (composition) of melting icicles (subject) on a frozen rock wall (context) with cool blue tones (ambiance), zoomed in (camera motion) maintaining close-up detail of water drips (action).
