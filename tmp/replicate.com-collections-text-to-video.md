# Generate videos

These models can generate and edit videos from text prompts and images. They use advanced AI techniques like diffusion models and latent space interpolation to create high-quality, controllable video content.

Key capabilities:

* **Text-to-video generation** \- Convert text prompts into video clips and animations. Useful for quickly prototyping video concepts.
* **Image-to-video generation** \- Animate still images into video.
* **Inpainting for infinite zoom** \- Use image inpainting to extrapolate video frames and create infinite zoom effects.
* **Stylization** \- Apply artistic filters like cartoonification to give videos a unique look and feel.

## State of the art: google/veo-3

For most people looking to generate custom videos from text prompts, we recommend google/veo-3

## Open source: tencent/hunyuan-video

The Hunyuan Video model by Tencent is an excellent open-source option, competitive with the best proprietary video models. Try adjusting the number of steps used for each frame to trade off between generation speed and detail.

## Other rankings

Generative video is a rapidly advancing field. Check out the arena and leaderboard at Artificial Analysis to see whatâ€™s popular today.
