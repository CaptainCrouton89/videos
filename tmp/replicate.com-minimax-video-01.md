## About video-01

MiniMax has officially launched its first AI-native video generation model, video-01.

This model supports the generation of high-definition videos at 720p resolution and 25fps, featuring cinematic camera movement effects. It can quickly create visually striking content based on text descriptions.

Video-01 boasts high compression rates, excellent text responsiveness, and diverse styles, while supporting native high resolution and high frame rate videos, comparable to cinematic quality.

Currently, video-01 supports generating videos up to 6 seconds long, with the next major version set to support videos up to 10 seconds long.

Video-01 offers two modes: text-to-video and image-to-video. You can choose to generate videos solely based on text descriptions or upload a reference image along with the text description to create the video.
